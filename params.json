  "body": "# Multiload-ng\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nMultiload-ng is a modern graphical system monitor. It's a near-complete rewrite of the good old GNOME multiload applet.\r\n\r\nIt supports the following panels:\r\n- XFCE (xfce4-panel)\r\n- LXDE (lxpanel)\r\n- MATE (mate-panel)\r\n\r\nIn addition it can be built as a standalone window, that is, not embedded in any panel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- Draw graphs of system resources\r\n- Very customizable\r\n- Color schemes support\r\n- Automatically adapts to container changes (panel or window)\r\n- Written in pure C with few dependencies - little CPU/memory footprint\r\n- Customizable tooltip style\r\n- Custom actions on double click\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n![Default configuration, small panel.

This was fixed in version 0.7.1. Read about this\r\n[here](http://wiki.lxde.org/en/How_to_write_plugins_for_LXPanel#Preconditions).\r\n\r\nNote that LXDE 0.7 or greater is required.\r\n\r\n#### Requirements for MATE panel\r\nIn addition to common requirements (see above)\r\nthese packages are required to build MATE panel plugin:\r\n\r\nPackage                     | Min version\r\n:-------------------------- | -------------:\r\nlibmatepanelapplet-4        | >= 1.7.0\r\n\r\nNote that MATE 1.7 or greater is required.\r\n\r\n#### Requirements for temperature graph\r\nThis is not a build-time requirement, rather a run-time one. The plugin search\r\nsysfs nodes corresponding to thermal zones, chooses the hottest one and draws it\r\nin the graph. The only requirement here is a Linux kernel compiled with\r\n`CONFIG_THERMAL (Generic Thermal sysfs driver)`. Any modern kernel (since 2010)\r\nsets it automatically, so it should be just fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Build instructions\r\n\r\n#### Get the source\r\nExecute the following command line (you must have git installed):  \r\n`git clone https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng`\r\n\r\nIf you don't have git, download the source ZIP [here](https://github.com/udda/multiload-ng/archive/master.zip).\r\n\r\n#### Configure\r\nMove to the directory that contains source code just cloned and run:  \r\n`./autogen.sh`\r\n\r\nNow run configure script:  \r\n`./configure --prefix=/usr`  \r\nChange prefix as needed (/usr is the default of most distros and it's just OK; if not specified it defaults to /usr/local).\r\n\r\nLubuntu users (and possibly others) have different libraries location. They may have to set directly *libdir*:  \r\n`./configure --libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`  \r\nIf plugin does not show up in the list of panel plugins, you could try to repeat build process with this configure setting.\r\n\r\nConfigure script automatically detects installed panels (and related development packages) and enables panel plugins accordingly.  \r\nYou can force enable/disable for some panels (and standalone). To learn how, along with other available options, type:  \r\n`./configure --help`\r\n\r\nThen run `./configure` with selected options.\r\n\r\n#### Build\r\nThis is simple. Move to the directory that contains source code and execute:  \r\n`make`\r\n\r\n#### Install/uninstall\r\nTo install (must run `make` before), execute:  \r\n`sudo make install`\r\n\r\nTo later uninstall you need source directory. If you deleted it, just download again, and run *Configure* part. Then execute:  \r\n`sudo make uninstall`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to contribute\r\nYou can contribute in several ways:\r\n\r\n* Suggest new features\r\n* Translate to new languages\r\n* Port the plugin to other panels\r\n* Report bugs\r\n* Implement something present in the [Wishlist](../../wiki/Wishlist)\r\n* Fix something present in [Known issues and TODO](../../wiki/Known-issues-and-TODO)\r\n* ...\r\n\r\nLook at the [Wiki](../../wiki), contains all the informations you will need.\r\n\r\nEach pull request will be considered and will get a response.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Q: Which are the differences with original Multiload applet?\r\nA: First of all, this project is *forked* from original Multiload. Multiload-ng has ALL the features of the original multiload, since they share the same codebase.\r\n\r\nThere are some notable differences:\r\n\r\n* Original multiload contains old and unmantained code, Multiload-ng is actively mantained\r\n* Multiload-ng has a [Wiki](../../wiki)!\r\n* Multiload-ng has additional graphs, and more will be added in the future\r\n* Multiload-ng has more graphical customizations, like individual colored border\r\n* Multiload-ng has color schemes support\r\n* Multiload-ng responds to mouse events with customizable actions\r\n* Multiload-ng can choose its orientation regardless of panel orientation\r\n* Multiload-ng can also be run without any panel\r\n* ...and so on\r\n\r\nTry it in your system and you won't come back!\r\n\r\n#### Q: Doesn't a system monitor use system resources by itself?\r\nA: Yes. This is true for every system monitor. That's why resources usage from Multiload-ng is kept to a negligible level.\r\n\r\n#### Q: I found a bug! How can I report?\r\nA: First, check wether this bug is already present in [issues list](../../issues) or in the appropriate [wiki page](../../wiki/Known-issues-and-TODO).\r\n\r\nIf not, you can then [create a new issue](../../issues/new) or add the bug you found in the [Known issues and TODO wiki page](../../wiki/Known-issues-and-TODO).\r\n\r\n#### Q: I have a suggestion that could be useful. How can I report?\r\nA: First, check wether your suggestion is already present in [this list](../../wiki/Wishlist).\r\n\r\nIf not, you can then add your suggestion in the [Wishlist wiki page](../../wiki/Wishlist).\r\n\r\n#### Q: Will you continue the development of Multiload-ng?\r\nA: Of course! To get an idea of future directions, take a look at the [Wishlist](../../wiki/Wishlist).\r\n\r\n",
